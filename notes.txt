Snakefile:

1-13: function read_bed_names:
see if the function should be included into the pipeline and if so see if there is an easier workflow to extract the values from the bed file. 
Also outsource the function into a own file. 

55-57: --balance_strands flag
doesn't need to be checked here, but can be a conditional in the process

59: minimap2_param could also be included as a flag with a set default value or just set in in the process
