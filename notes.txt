Snakefile:

1-13: function read_bed_names:
see if the function should be included into the pipeline and if so see if there is an easier workflow to extract the values from the bed file. 
Also outsource the function into a own file. 

55-57: --balance_strands flag
doesn't need to be checked here, but can be a conditional in the process

59: minimap2_param could also be included as a flag with a set default value or just set in in the process


rule MAP_1D:
catfishq:
https://github.com/philres/catfishq

used to cat fastq reads and for subsampling of the reads 
potentially used to subsample reads, but only by stopping after a certain number of reads. 

--max_n was a config paramter in the snakemakepipeline which was not used in the end. default was 0, which is used now 
Step could be used for subsample but make extra process for that

rule SPLIT_READS:
fastq file as output which is in the fasta_filtered foulder (rename folder later?)


TODOS:
Split process pipes into smaller bits?
